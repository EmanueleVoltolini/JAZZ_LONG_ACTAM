### Go crash, boom, bang!
At the top-left of the composition page, there's the Drum Machine. You can set it by selecting the desired metric for your backing track (3/4, 4/4, 5/4), choose also if you want your rhythm to be shuffled or straight. Have a look at our pre-compiled presets or do it by yourself clicking on the white squares, you will see the squares in the stroke selector go green. Press "Play" to hear what it sounds like. The round visualizer, or "radar" will help you see the rhythmic structure in polar coordinates.
